<p>We just pushed out a small May update (0.5.4) to the <a href="https://github.com/WindowsAzure/azure-sdk-tools">Azure SDK for Node.js</a>, with which we now deploy:</p>
<ul><li>node.js 0.6.17</li>
<li>iisnode 0.1.19</li>
</ul><p>Here are the important changes and additions in this release:</p>
<ul><li>The updated node.js version addresses the <a href="%22%09http://blog.nodejs.org/2012/05/07/http-server-security-vulnerability-please-upgrade-to-0-6-17/%20">recently announced node.js security vulnerability</a>. The vulnerability affects all server-side deployments using versions prior to 0.6.17. If you have deployed a node.js application on Azure using our tooling, you are probably using a version of node.js that is vulerable. <strong>Please redeploy your application using the updated tooling to ensure your deployment is secure.</strong></li>
<li>This is not completely new, but a few weeks ago we also released a <strong>refresh (0.5.3) of the <a href="https://github.com/WindowsAzure/azure-sdk-for-node/">npm package for Azure</a></strong>, adding support for accessing the Azure role service runtime. That enables you to: get role configuration settings, work with local role resources (including local storage), get information about the current role instance, as well as other role instances in your application. We have a <a href="https://github.com/WindowsAzure/azure-sdk-for-node/tree/master/examples/serviceexplorer">nice example of this functionality posted here</a>. </li>
<li>iisnode 0.1.19 brings <a href="http://tomasz.janczuk.org/2012/05/yaml-configuration-support-in-iisnode.html">improved configuration support using YAML files</a>. For a lot of scenarios, you may now be able to configure your app by deploying an <strong>iisnode.yml file</strong>, instead of messy XML inside your Web.config.</li></ul>
~~~ yaml
# The optional iisnode.yml file provides overrides of 
# the iisnode configuration settings specified in web.config.

node_env: production
nodeProcessCommandLine: "c:\program files\nodejs\node.exe"
nodeProcessCountPerApplication: 1
# so on...
