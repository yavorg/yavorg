<p>Folks, I&rsquo;ll be speaking on WCF at the Silverlight Firestarter event in December. It&rsquo;s a one day, global, live streamed and on demand event keynoted by Scott Guthrie. The focus of the event will be to demonstrate that over the last 3 releases Silverlight has grown up to be a very powerful platform for creatingÂ engaging experiences on the web/Desktop/phone.</p>
