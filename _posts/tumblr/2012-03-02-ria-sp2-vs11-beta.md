<p>Visual Studio 11 Beta went out a few days ago, and with it we have a refreshed RIA Services SP2 version that supports all VS 11 goodness:</p>
<ul><li>Universal Providers</li>
<li>Support for the new Metro UI</li>
<li>Miscellaneous small changes to adapt to changes in project system, msbuild, and the designer.</li>
</ul><p>However, there are some kinks that you should be aware of&hellip; it is a Beta after all:</p>
<ul><li>If you try to use the <strong>Data Binding picker from the Properties pane</strong> to bind a property (for example the text in a TextBlock) to a property on a Domain Data Source, you&rsquo;ll see it is not available. We are looking at addressing this issue.<br/><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/posts/tumblr/tumblr_m0a8chKYZH1qccglw.png" style="margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto"/>Â </li>
<li>Universal Providers have a known issue where <strong>Windows Authentication and Role Providers don&rsquo;t work</strong> as you might expect. If you switch your web app containing your Domain Service to Windows auth, be sure to make the change shown below. Having to do this is a limitation that will go away after Beta.</li>
</ul>
