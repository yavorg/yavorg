Yavor is currently at Snowflake, working on developer experience for Snowflake Container Services. Prior to that, he worked at *Docker*, where he developed product-led growth strategies to accelerate developer and team adoption. Before that he co-founded *Fusebit*, a startup that makes in-product integrations painless for SaaS developers. In more ancient history, he worked at *Auth0*, *Hulu*, and *Microsoft*, where he led some early efforts to enable serverless computing on Azure with a focus on mobile developers, and also worked on open-source frameworks that aim to make the cloud accessible from any platform. When not enjoying the beauty of the Pacific Northwest, you can usually find him on an ill-advised (mis)adventure in some remote destination.
