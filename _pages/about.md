Yavor is a Product Manager at [Extend](http://goextend.io), a startup that makes in-product extensibility and integrations painless for SaaS developers. He spends his time talking to customers, designing features, and shepherding the product roadmap. Previously, he worked at *Hulu* and *Microsoft*, where he led some early efforts to enable serverless computing on Azure with a focus on mobile developers, and also worked on open-source frameworks that aim to make the cloud accessible from any platform. When not enjoying the beauty of the Pacific Northwest, you can usually find him on an ill-advised (mis)adventure in some remote destination.
