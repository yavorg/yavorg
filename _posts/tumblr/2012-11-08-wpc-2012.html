<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_md7dv9Vn3N1qd717fo1_r1_500.gif"/><br/><p>I&rsquo;m very excited to be speaking at the upcoming <a href="http://www.wpc2012.it/">WPC</a> conference (<a href="https://twitter.com/wpc_2012">@wpc_2012</a>) in Milan on November 20-22. My first session is an overview of the Windows Azure SDK and I&rsquo;m co-presenting that session with Francesco Diaz (<a href="https://twitter.com/francedit">@francedit</a>), who introduced me to the conference and made it possible for me to attend. In my second talk, I will focus on writing lightweight apps on Azure using Node.js and Mobile Services. Here are the two abstracts, also you can check the <a href="http://www.wpc2012.it/Agenda">agenda page</a> for more information. I&rsquo;m excited about my talks and looking forward to making new friends in Italy!</p>

<p><strong>CI3018 - Catching up to startups: Lightweight app hosting in Windows Azure</strong></p>
<p>You think Heroku or Parse offer the easiest and fastest way to get started with an app in the cloud? Think again… Windows Azure has added some exciting new features that make it as fast and agile as its most hip competitors. Come learn how to host Node applications in Azure websites and virtual machines using only a text editor and some command-line tools… even from a Mac. We will also show how to develop a backend for your Azure mobile app in minutes, whether you are using Windows 8, Windows Phone 8, or even IOS. This session will be full of great open-source technologies and will also give you a peek at the team’s plans going forward.</p>
