<blockquote>
<p><strong>Writing Node.js apps for Windows Azure<br/></strong><strong>Friday, May 4th: 2:05pm â€“ 2:55pm</strong></p>
<p>Server-side JavaScript? On Windows Azure? Has hell frozen over? Learn about how Azure is quickly turning into an open cloud platform that supports a variety of runtimes: .NET, Java, PHP, and even Node.js! In this session, we will show how to build exciting realtime apps in JavaScript, and how to run them in the cloud. We will take advantage of features such as storage, caches, and queues to make our app scale without a hitch. We will also share the team&rsquo;s plans for future Windows Azure improvements and give you a chance to voice your opinion.</p>
