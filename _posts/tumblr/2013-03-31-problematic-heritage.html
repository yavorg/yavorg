<p>What was going to be a simple link I wanted to share (via <a href="http://www.empiricalzeal.com/">Aatish</a>) got me thinking about the legacy of &ldquo;problematic&rdquo; monuments across the Balkans. Regardless of what they symbolize, most of these have fallen into disrepair due to the fall of the regimes that erected them in the first place.</p>
<p>The original post here shared a series of &ldquo;spomenik&rdquo; monuments built throughout former Yugoslavia. Here is a <a href="http://www.theasc.com/site/blog/johns-bailiwick/spomenik-jan-kempenaers-and-the-end-of-history/">great essay by John Bailey</a> that puts these in context.</p>

<p>This reminded me of the ongoing debate in Bulgaria over what should be done with similar crumbling monuments. I remember many of these from my childhood.</p>
<p>A recent example is the Sofia monument to celebrate 1300 years since the creation of the Bulgarian state (паметникът &ldquo;1300 години България&rdquo; пред НДК). Built in 1981, it has been falling apart since then and has found uses as a graffiti canvas and skateboard park among other things. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://whata.org/blog/zashcho-ne-tryabva-da-se-sbarya-pametnikt-pred-ndk">public debate</a> is ongoing here with <a href="http://transformatori.net/ndk/">proposals</a> ranging from demolishing the monument, renovating it while maintaining some of the original symbolism, or re-purposing it into something more &ldquo;useful&rdquo; such as a mall or an urban sports facility. </p>
<p>Another one is Buzludja (Бузлуджа), built in 1981 on one of Bulgaria&rsquo;s tallest peaks to serve as the venue for a communist party convention. I&rsquo;ve written about this one before <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url tumblr/2012-03-01-buzludja %}">here</a>.</p>

<p>Another one that I keenly remember from my childhood is the &ldquo;Banner of Peace&rdquo; (Знаме на мира) monument and park, built in 1979 to accommodate a UNESCO-supported festival of children&rsquo;s art. </p>

<p>One of the first color photos my parents have of me as a child was taken there, back when you had to have a photographer take one for you. Every country that participated donated a bell, that was then installed as part of the concrete structure around the perimeter, which allows visitors to interact with the monument as they walk around it. Here is a link to a great <a href="http://www.dnevnik.bg/bigpicture/2009/08/15/765840_30_godini_monument_zname_na_mira/">photo-essay</a> about the state of the park 30 years after it was built. </p>
<p>Some of the images above are taken from the <a href="http://www.nikolamihov.com/forget_your_past.html">&ldquo;Forget Your Past&rdquo; project by Bulgarian photographer Nikola Mihov</a>, which contains many more photographs of soviet-era monuments around Bulgaria. You can find the book <a href="http://books.janet45.com/books/742">here</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;re seeing increased attention in documenting these memorials and a lively dialog about their future. Without in any way condoning the governments that erected them or the ideas that they capture, I do believe they need to be kept as an important part of our historical and architectural record.</p>
