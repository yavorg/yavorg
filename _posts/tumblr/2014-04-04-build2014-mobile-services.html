<p>//build/ 2014 wrapped up Friday, and it has been a great opportunity for our team to highlight an exciting set of new enterprise feature we&rsquo;ve been working on for the last few months. We started with our segment in Scott&rsquo;s keynote, which showcased a killer use case for the modern enterprise: how to<strong> build a service using .NET, add authentication with Active Directory, save documents to SharePoint, and build cross-platform clients with Xamarin</strong>. You can skip forward to <strong>45:23</strong> in the video if you are just interested in the mobile segment</p>
