<blockquote>
<p>This session presents an overview of how to expose data to a Silverlight application by accessing web services in the enterprise. We will cover a spectrum of options spanning from the client HTTP stack to WCF to WCF Data Services. We will first show off the functionality of the new client HTTP stack with respect to HTTP verbs, headers, responses, and authentication in the context of the REST protocol. On the WCF front we will walk through a demonstration of how to use Silverlight with a new WCF message pattern designed for LOB applications called server push enabling scenarios such as email clients and real-time chat. Lastly, we will end with a drill down of Silverlight friendly new features in WCF Data Services to quickly and easily create enterprise Silverlight client applications from various data sources.</p>
