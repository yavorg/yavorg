I was recently going through some old boxes and ran across this... 8 years of Microsoft speaker badges. Before I recycle all of these... some highlights:

* Overall best badge goes to the folks who organized *Microsoft Days Bulgaria 2011*, who went with a whole airline theme that was reflected in the speaker and staff shirts, badges, and the design of the event overall 
* Cooleset badge goes to the folks at [Ã˜redev](http://oredev.org) for embedding an awesome prism in theirs. Runner up goes to [Silicon Valley Code Camp](https://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com) for a lanyard that's also a working zipper.
* Most boring and also most wasteful goes to *TechReady/TechEd*, who stuck to this thick fabric sleeve with a full booklet included in a back pocket for a number of years, even after everybody in the industry had moved on
